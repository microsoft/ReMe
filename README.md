With the emergence of new capabilities in ambient sensing technology and Large Language Models, we were inspired to create **ReMe**, a personalized cognitive training framework designed to create AI chatbots that facilitate personalized cognitive training. It has the potential to be highly beneficial in the area of cognitive health, such as in the prevention and early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease.
